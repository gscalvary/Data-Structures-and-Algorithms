# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

Hi there.

I produced this code while studying for tech interviews, which I am still doing as I write this.
The interface is very simple and was implemented just to test the underlying data structures and algorithms.

If you plan to execute the same study plan I would recommend implementing in the following sequence so earlier work
can be used as a foundation for later work:

- Linked List
 - Hash Table (the linked list may be used for handling collisions via chaining)
 - Queue (the linked list may be used as the basis for your queue)     
  - Merge Sort (an easy to understand version of merge sort iterates over a queue)                                     
 - Priority Queue, a linked list isn't the greatest implementation but it serves to lend understanding to the concepts.
 - Stack (the linked list may be used as the basis for your stack)                                                     
- Set                                                                                                                  
- Quick Sort                                                                                                           
- Tree                                                                                                                 
- Graph                                                                                                                
 - Depth First Search (takes a graph as input!)                                                                        
 - Breadth First Search (takes a graph as input and uses a queue for ordering!)
 - Dijkstra Shortest Path (takes a graph as input but also needs the Priority Queue)
