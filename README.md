# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

Hi there.

I produced this code while studying for tech interviews, which I am still doing as I write this.
The interface is very simple and was implemented just to test the underlying data structures and algorithms.

If you plan to execute the same study plan I would recommend implementing in the following sequence so earlier work
can be used as a foundation for later work:

- Linked List
 - Hash Table (the linked list may be used for handling collisions via chaining)
 - Queue (the linked list may be used as the basis for your queue)
  - Merge Sort (an easy to understand version of merge sort iterates over a queue)
 - Stack (the linked list may be used as the basis for your stack)
- Set
- Quick Sort
- Tree
